# YouTube Classic Polymer
Browse YouTube like it's 2015.

**YouTube Classic Polymer** is an extension that restyles YouTube's polymer layout to look like the old design from around 2015.

In addition to that, it also gives you options to remove/change some things on the site, such as:
- Disabling miniplayer
- Static thumbnails instead of live previews
- Collapsing the guide menu by default
