# YouTube Classic Polymer
Browse YouTube like it's 2015.

**YouTube Classic Polymer** is an extension that restyles YouTube's polymer layout to look like the old design from around 2015.

In addition to that, it also removes and blocks some new features from the site, such as:
- Miniplayer
- Animated thumbnails
- "Skeleton" styles. (The empty background elements you see when the page is loading.)

*The goal is to add some of those features as options in a future release.*
